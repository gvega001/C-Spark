C-Spark: A Beginner-Friendly, High-Powered Programming Language ðŸš€

Introduction

C-Spark is a modern programming language designed to make coding accessible without sacrificing rigor. It bridges the gap between beginner-friendly syntax and real-world programming concepts, making it an ideal tool for students, educators, and developers who want to learn the fundamentals of programming while working with a language that translates into C.

Features

ðŸ”¹ Lexer & Parser

Efficient tokenization and abstract syntax tree (AST) generation.

Supports variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

ðŸ”¹ Transpiler

Converts C-Spark code into C for execution.

Optimized for efficiency and scalability.

ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Debugging

Inline hints provide real-time error messages and suggestions.

Helps students understand common syntax mistakes.

ðŸ”¹ Gamification & Achievements

Interactive learning through a built-in achievements system.

Encourages students to progress through coding challenges.

ðŸ”¹ Scalability & Future Expansion

Designed with modular components to support future extensions.

Planned support for Python transpilation.

Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

GCC or Clang (for compiling C output).

Git (to clone the repository).

Visual Studio Code or any C-supported IDE.

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/gvega001/C-Spark.git
cd C-Spark

Build the project:

make

Run the C-Spark Interpreter:

./c-spark <your_script.cspark>

Usage

Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple C-Spark program:

let x = 10;
let y = 20;
print(x + y);

After transpilation, it generates the following C output:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    printf("%d\n", x + y);
    return 0;
}
